## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Squircle is available through SPM. To install it, simply add the URL in Xcode: `https://github.com/neobeppe/Squircle`

### Cocoapods

Squircle is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

pod 'Squircle'

```

## Usage

### Squircle

Squircle is an UIView extension, and can be used in different ways:

```swift
let view = UIView()
view.squircle()
```

Just apply conventional squircle radius to the view. If the view is a square, i'll obtain the same effect as iOS springboard icons, if it's a rectangle i'll obtain rounded corners based on a square built on smallest side.

Squircle is also an CALayer extension, permitting you to add a squircle mask directly on a layer.
Rules are the same as the UIView methods, invocation is:

```swift
let layer = CALayer()
layer.applySquircle()
```

### Squircle with border

If you want to apply squircle with a border use the dedicated methods:


```swift
let view = UIView()
view.squircleWithBorder(width: CGFloat, color: UIColor)
```

```swift
let layer = CALayer()
layer.applySquircleWithBorder(width: CGFloat, color: UIColor)
```

### Remove squircle

To remove the squircle from a UIView:


```swift
view.removeSquircle()
```

or directly on CALayer:


```swift
layer.removeSquircle()
```

If a border has been added to the squircle, both functions above will remove it too.


### Remove border

To remove only the border from a squircle:


```swift
view.removeSquircleBorder()
```

or directly on CALayer:


```swift
layer.removeSquircleBorder()
```
